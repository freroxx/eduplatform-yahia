Introduction\n**Purpose**: Introduce the topic and present your thesis\n\n**Components**:\n- **Hook**: An interesting opening to grab attention\n- **Background information**: Context about the topic\n- **Thesis statement**: Your main argument or point\n\n**Example Introduction**:\n\"Technology has revolutionized the way we communicate. In the past decade, social media platforms have transformed how people interact, share information, and build relationships. While social media offers many benefits, it also poses significant challenges to genuine human connection and privacy.\"\n\n### 2. Body Paragraphs\n**Purpose**: Support your thesis with evidence and examples\n\n**Structure** (each paragraph):\n- **Topic sentence**: Main idea of the paragraph\n- **Supporting details**: Evidence, examples, explanations\n- **Analysis**: How the evidence supports your thesis\n- **Concluding sentence**: Transition to the next paragraph\n\n**Example Body Paragraph**:\n\"One major benefit of social media is its ability to connect people across geographical boundaries. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram allow families separated by distance to maintain close relationships through regular communication. For instance, grandparents can watch their grandchildren grow up through shared photos and videos, even when living in different countries. This connectivity has strengthened family bonds and reduced the sense of isolation that distance once created.\"\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n**Purpose**: Summarize your arguments and provide final thoughts\n\n**Components**:\n- **Restate thesis**: Rephrase your main argument\n- **Summarize main points**: Brief review of key evidence\n- **Final thought**: Broader implications or call to action\n\n**Example Conclusion**:\n\"In conclusion, while social media has transformed communication by enabling global connectivity and information sharing, it has also created new challenges around privacy and authentic relationships. As we continue to integrate these technologies into our daily lives, we must strive to balance the benefits of digital connection with the need for genuine human interaction. The future of communication depends on our ability to use social media as a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, meaningful personal relationships.\"\n\n## Types of Essays\n\n### 1.

Compare and Contrast Essays\n- **Purpose**: Analyze similarities and differences\n- **Focus**: Balanced examination of subjects\n- **Example topic**: \"Online vs. Traditional Education\"\n\n## Writing Process\n\n### 1. Pre-writing\n- **Brainstorm** ideas and topics\n- **Research** background information\n- **Create an outline** to organize thoughts\n- **Consider your audience** and purpose\n\n### 2. Drafting\n- **Write freely** without worrying about perfection\n- **Focus on getting ideas down** on paper\n- **Follow your outline** but be flexible\n- **Don't edit** as you write the first draft\n\n### 3.

Wordiness\n- **Wordy**: \"In my personal opinion, I believe that...\"\n- **Better**: \"I believe...\" or simply state your position\n\n### 5.

Local Revision (Paragraph Level)\n- **Paragraph unity**: Does each paragraph focus on one main idea?\n- **Paragraph development**: Are ideas fully explained and supported?\n- **Transitions**: Do paragraphs connect smoothly?\n- **Balance**: Are paragraphs roughly similar in length and development?\n\n### 3. Sentence-Level Editing\n- **Clarity**: Are sentences easy to understand?\n- **Conciseness**: Can wordy phrases be shortened?\n- **Variety**: Is there variety in sentence length and structure?\n- **Grammar**: Are there errors in agreement, tense, etc.?\n- **Punctuation**: Are commas, semicolons, etc. used correctly?\n\n### 4.

Abstract**\n- **Length**: 150-250 words\n- **Content**: Purpose, methodology, key findings, conclusions\n- **Function**: Allows readers to quickly understand the paper's scope\n\n**Example Abstract**:\n\"This study examines the impact of social media usage on academic performance among undergraduate students. Using a survey of 500 students across three universities, we analyzed the relationship between time spent on social platforms and GPA scores. Results indicate a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.34) between excessive social media use (>3 hours daily) and academic achievement. However, students who used social media for educational purposes showed improved collaboration skills. These findings suggest that the quality of social media engagement, rather than quantity alone, determines academic outcomes. Universities should consider developing guidelines for productive academic social media use.\"\n\n**2.

        question: "Read the following passage and answer the questions:\n\n**The Benefits of Urban Gardens**\n\nUrban gardens are becoming increasingly popular in cities worldwide. These green spaces, ranging from small rooftop plots to large community gardens, offer numerous benefits to both individuals and communities. Research has shown that urban gardening can improve mental health, provide fresh produce, and strengthen community bonds.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages is the positive impact on mental wellbeing. Gardening activities reduce stress levels and provide a sense of accomplishment. The physical activity involved also contributes to better overall health. Additionally, urban gardens help combat food insecurity by providing access to fresh, nutritious vegetables and fruits, especially in areas where grocery stores are scarce.\n\nFurthermore, community gardens create social connections among neighbors. People from different backgrounds come together to share knowledge, tools, and harvests. This collaboration builds stronger, more cohesive communities and can even reduce crime rates in neighborhoods.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. What is the main topic of this passage?\n2. List three benefits of urban gardens mentioned in the text.\n3. How do urban gardens help with food insecurity?\n4. What does the word 'combat' mean in this context?\n5. What inference can you make about the author's attitude toward urban gardens?",
        solution: "1. **Main topic**: The benefits of urban gardens in cities and their positive impact on individuals and communities.\n\n2. **Three benefits**:\n   - Improve mental health and reduce stress\n   - Provide fresh produce and combat food insecurity\n   - Strengthen community bonds and create social connections\n\n3. **Food insecurity help**: Urban gardens provide access to fresh, nutritious vegetables and fruits, especially in areas where grocery stores are scarce.\n\n4. **'Combat' meaning**: To fight against or work to reduce/eliminate (food insecurity).\n\n5. **Author's attitude**: The author has a positive, supportive attitude toward urban gardens, presenting only benefits and using positive language throughout the passage."

        difficulty: "Hard",
        duration: "45 minutes",
        points: 30,
        question: "Read the following excerpt and complete the character analysis:\n\n*From a short story:*\n\n\"Maria stood at the crossroads, her heart pounding. To the left lay the familiar path home to her family's expectations and the security of tradition. To the right stretched an unknown road leading to the university and her dreams of becoming a doctor. She clutched her acceptance letter, remembering her father's words: 'Education is fine for boys, but girls should focus on family.' Yet her mother had secretly saved money for years, whispering, 'Follow your heart, mija.' The setting sun painted the sky orange as Maria took a deep breath and stepped forward.\"\n\n**Questions:**\n1. What type of conflict is Maria facing?\n2. What do the two paths symbolize?\n3. How do the father's and mother's attitudes differ?\n4. What does the setting sun symbolize in this context?\n5. Predict which path Maria might choose and explain your reasoning.",
        solution: "1. **Type of conflict**: Internal conflict (person vs. self) - Maria is torn between family expectations and personal dreams. Also person vs. society (traditional gender roles).\n\n2. **Path symbolism**:\n   - Left path: tradition, family expectations, conventional female roles, security\n   - Right path: independence, education, breaking with tradition, uncertainty but opportunity\n\n3. **Parents' attitudes**:\n   - Father: traditional, believes education is primarily for males, emphasizes family roles for women\n   - Mother: supportive of Maria's dreams, progressive despite societal constraints, has been secretly preparing for this moment\n\n4. **Setting sun symbolism**: End of one phase of life/childhood, transition period, time of decision-making, perhaps the end of traditional ways\n\n5. **Prediction** (example answer): Maria will likely choose the right path (university) because:\n   - She has her acceptance letter ready\n   - Her mother's support and sacrifice (saving money)\n   - The phrase 'stepped forward' suggests movement toward the future/dreams\n   - The story structure suggests this is a coming-of-age moment where she chooses independence"
